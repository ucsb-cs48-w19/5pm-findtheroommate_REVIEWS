## Summary of Features and Feedback
A web app for UCSB students to find roommates at a location away from home for summer internships, traveling, etc. 
Users can create an account with their email, then make a post by inputting descriptions. The most recent post will show up on the home page.
I liked that the web app is very simple to set up and use. User verification can be improved by adding third-party oauth or checking that users can only sign in with a valid UCSB email address.
The post page can be improved by adding input fields for housing dates and location. The view page can be improved by adding comment section, social media links to learn more about the potential roommate, or a "contact if interested" feature.
In general, the web app can be improved by adding more CSS and Javascript to make it look prettier.

## Kanban Board Feedback
The Kanban board was in alignment with the features. Kanban board included user stories for users to be able to log in, make posts, and view posts, which were all implemented in the MVP. 
Issues labeled under the done column of the Kanban board included creating database, passing information into database, and adding basic CSS, which were all implemented in the MVP.

## README.md Feedback
We were not able to set up the product and compile on our computers by following the instructions. It was not claer where the virtual environment should be created on our local computer, and the instructions for installing on Mac can be improved by providing correct commands and more detailed steps for installation


## Closing thoughts
I liked that all the functions on the app were clear and easy to use, expecially the features for posting and viewing posts.
The most impactful opportunity for improvement would be adding more CSS and javascript to make the website look prettier and easier to navigate.
One more thing that was good about the web app was that registration and setting up an account was very simple and easy.
